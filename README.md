## Hello

I am a data scientist currently working towards a master’s degree in statistics at the London School of Economics.

I’ve previously worked in survey research, including at the U.S. Census Bureau. My resume can be found on my personal website [here](https://jacobeliason.com/resume).

I enjoy running, cycling, and film photography.
